## üìä Container Ports

| Service | Port | URL | Purpose |
|---------|------|-----|---------|
| Production | 3000 | http://localhost:3000 | Main app |
| Development | 5173 | http://localhost:5173 | Dev server |
| Health Check | 3000/health | http://localhost:3000/health | Health status |

## üîß Useful Tips

### **Multiple Commands**
```bash
# Chain commands
make clean build run

# Background monitoring
make run && make logs
```

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Override ports
PROD_PORT=8080 make run
DEV_PORT=3000 make run-dev
```

### **Debugging**
```bash
# Check container details
make shell
ps aux              # Inside container
cat /var/log/nginx/error.log  # Nginx logs

# Check from host
docker inspect visualsort-app
docker exec visualsort-app nginx -t  # Test config
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
```bash
make stats          # Resource usage
make health         # Health status
curl http://localhost:3000/health  # Direct health check
```

## üö® Emergency Commands

```bash
make stop           # Stop everything
make clean-all      # Nuclear cleanup
